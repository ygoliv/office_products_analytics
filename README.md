##  Analysis and Insights

### **SQL & Employee Data Analysis**
- Extracted **hiring trends** and **active employee count over time**.
- Used **date joins** to analyze workforce retention and turnover patterns.

### **Python & Jupyter Notebook Findings** *(Uses `product_sales_monthly.csv`)*
- **Sales are highly skewed**, with **a few high-value transactions disproportionately impacting revenue**.
- **Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier** dominates sales, while **low-performing products show potential for optimization**.
- **Revenue distribution is uneven**, with **outliers significantly influencing total sales**.
- **Median annual sales remained stable, but high variance suggests reliance on large, inconsistent purchases**.

### **Databricks & SparkSQL Analysis** *(Uses `Sales_Data.csv`)*
- **Sales Trends**: Revenue **peaked mid-2010, early 2012**, followed by a decline.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Select few customers generate the highest revenue.
- **Product Performance**: **Development leads** in sales, **Consulting has growth potential**, while **Training underperforms**.
